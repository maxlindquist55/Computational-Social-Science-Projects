It is worth mentioning that my LASSO model had a lower RSME on the cross-validation dataset than it did on the test dataset, which is likely because the k-folds validation approach evaluates the model on a larger portion of the data compared to a single fixed test set. The more data points the model is evaluated on, the more reliable the RMSE estimate is likely to be."

    "Bias-variance tradeoff refers to the problem in machine learning in which the practicioner needs to select a model that accurately captures the often-times complex underlying relationships between predictors and outcomes, while avoiding capturing irrelevant noise. Models that are biased are oversimplified models that fit neither the training nor testing data. Biased models are at risk for underfitting, which means that the model does not capture the relationship between features and outcomes. Models with high levels of variance cause overfitting, which occurs when the model closely fits the training data but has high error on the testing data. This higher error resutling from testing dataset is a result of the model capturing noise while being fitted to the training dataset.\n",

    "Based off of the LASSO and Ridge Regression models, **I would pilot the program in the Southeast and South regions of the United States**, as both regions have substantially larger coefficients than the Northeast and West regions. I would encourage the policy maker to include program modules that **promote or create opportunities for physical activity and weight loss**, as inactivity and obesity are to be significant contributors to the prevalence of diabetes in both the LASSO and Ridge Regression models. Additionally, the program should target **women approaching or over 65 years of age**. If the policy maker wanted to account for race, she should consider implementing her program in **black communities**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth mentioning that the L1 regularization used in LASSO has zeroed out several potentially important racial and age-related features related to diabetes prevalence. I suspect this is due to multicollinearity of factors of region and race. For example, certain counties classified as the South may have a higher percentage of Black or African Americans, who are at a higher risk for diabetes due to a combination of environmental, socioeconomic, and lifestyle factors. Thus, it is possible that L1 punished features pertaining to race in order to mitigate the multicollinearity between race and region. Unfortunately, this is a major shortcoming for the model, as, in the case, it prevents our ability to better provide diabetes to specific racial or age groups. **Thus, while the LASSO model technically performs better, I would recommend the Ridge Regression model in that it can provide a more complete set of coefficients at the cost of a slightly lower `RSME`, which likely has more utility in a policy-related or public health setting.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I would feel confident deploying the Ridge Regression model to help policymakers identify groups or regions to pilot programs that promote healthy habits pertaining to diet and exercise, or improve access to quality healthcare services and nutritious foods, as these programs come with little potential for harm.
