    "**MODEL DESCRIPTION(S):** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Model One -- Ordinary Least Squares***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Logic:** Ordinary Least Squares is a simple regression technique that models the linear relationship between outcomes and features by finding the best-fitting straight line that explains the variation between those two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:** Ordinary Least Squares models assume linear relationship between features and outcomes, homoscedasticity, and no multicollinearity between features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:** Ordinary Least Squares models are simple and easy to understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:** Ordinary Least Squares models are very to underfitting due to their simplicity. They are also sensative to outliers and cannot model nonlinear or multicollinear relationships between features and outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plausible utility:** This is likely going to be the least plausible model for policymakers to use in this situation because it risks oversimplifying the relationship between diabetes, region, race, age, obesity, and inactivity. Similarly, the features in this dataset are likely colinear, which presents a problem for Ordinary Least Squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Model Two -- Ridge Regression***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Logic:** Ridge Regression addresses some of the problems of Ordinary Least Squares by imposing a penalty on the size of the coefficients, which is called the L2 regularization term. This penalty term prevents the coefficients from becoming too large, which mitigates issues related to multicollinearity and overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:** Ridge Regression still assumes a linear relationship between features and outcomes, homoscedasticity, and no endogeneity. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:** Unlike Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge Regression can handle multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:** Unlike LASSO, Ridge Regression does not perform feature selection, which means irrelevant features will be included in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plausible utility:** This model seems to occupy the mid-ground between Ordinary Least Squares and LASSO. While Ridge Regression may include insignificant features, we can still gauge the significance of diabetic risk factors without having to worry about the L1 parameter zeroing out coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Model Three -- LASSO***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Logic:**  LASSO is a regression technique that addresses the limitations of Ordinary Least Squares by adding an L1 regularization term to the linear regression model. This L1 regularization imposes a penalty on the size of the coefficients, which, unlike the L2 regularization term in Ridge Regression, many zero out coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:** LASSO still assumes a linear relationship between features and outcomes, homoscedasticity, and no endogeneity. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:** LASSO is very useful for feature selection, which can help policymakers target populations, regions, or lifestyle/environmental factors that are significant contributors to diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:** The major drawback with LASSO is that the model's L1 parameter risks setting coefficients that cause multicollinearity to zero. This is an issue if we one of the zeroed features is one of our main treatments of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plausible utility:** This model grants policymakers the ability to target features that contribute to diabetes, while minimizing varience and bias."

    "Bias-variance tradeoff refers to the problem in machine learning in which the practicioner needs to select a model that accurately captures the often-times complex underlying relationships between predictors and outcomes, while avoiding capturing irrelevant noise. Models that are biased are oversimplified models that fit neither the training nor testing data. Biased models are at risk for underfitting, which means that the model does not capture the relationship between features and outcomes. Models with high levels of variance cause overfitting, which occurs when the model closely fits the training data but has high error on the testing data. This higher error resutling from testing dataset is a result of the model capturing noise while being fitted to the training dataset.\n",

    "Based off of the LASSO and Ridge Regression models, **I would pilot the program in the Southeast and South regions of the United States**, as both regions have substantially larger coefficients than the Northeast and West regions. I would encourage the policy maker to include program modules that **promote or create opportunities for physical activity and weight loss**, as inactivity and obesity are to be significant contributors to the prevalence of diabetes in both the LASSO and Ridge Regression models. Additionally, the program should target **women approaching or over 65 years of age**. If the policy maker wanted to account for race, she should consider implementing her program in **black communities**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth mentioning that the L1 regularization used in LASSO has zeroed out several potentially important racial and age-related features related to diabetes prevalence. I suspect this is due to multicollinearity of factors of region and race. For example, certain counties classified as the South may have a higher percentage of Black or African Americans, who are at a higher risk for diabetes due to a combination of environmental, socioeconomic, and lifestyle factors. Thus, it is possible that L1 punished features pertaining to race in order to mitigate the multicollinearity between race and region. Unfortunately, this is a major shortcoming for the model, as, in the case, it prevents our ability to better provide diabetes to specific racial or age groups. **Thus, while the LASSO model technically performs better, I would recommend the Ridge Regression model in that it can provide a more complete set of coefficients at the cost of a slightly lower `RSME`, which likely has more utility in a policy-related or public health setting.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I would feel confident deploying the Ridge Regression model to help policymakers identify groups or regions to pilot programs that promote healthy habits pertaining to diet and exercise, or improve access to quality healthcare services and nutritious foods, as these programs come with little potential for harm.
